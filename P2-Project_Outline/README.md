## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A coffee app that allows users to post and keep track of in-depth reviews of different coffees, including images, comments, tasting notes, and a star rating.

This idea was inspired by similar, physical notebooks that provide useful prompts for thoughtfully reviewing and tracking coffees. Coffee lovers and baristas will find the app's features useful for getting to know their own coffee preferences better, tracking where they have had their favorite coffees, and enhancing coffee culture in specific communities.
